# Selecting an Architecture Style to Support Modularity and Ease of 
Maintenance ZeroShot

## Status
Proposed

## Context
 Flood Monitoring and Management System (FMMS) involves multiple 
components—data ingestion, processing, alerting, and user management—that may 
evolve independently over time. For flexibility in development, deployment, and 
maintenance, the architecture needs a modular design that enables isolated updates, 
scalability, and troubleshooting for individual components without impacting the entire 
system. The architecture style must support this modularity, allowing FMMS to adapt to 
future requirements and updates efficiently

## Decision

[Decision
Adopt a Microservices Architecture for the Flood Monitoring and Management System (FMMS).

Rationale
Modularity: Microservices allow each component of FMMS (data ingestion, processing, alerting, user management) to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This modularity enables teams to work on different components in parallel, speeding up the development process.

Independent Deployment: Each microservice can be deployed independently, allowing for isolated updates and reducing the risk of downtime or bugs that could affect the entire system during an update.

Scalability: Microservices can be scaled individually based on their demand. For instance, if the data ingestion component needs to handle a significantly increased load during severe weather alerts, it can be scaled without the need to scale the entire system.

Technology Agnostic: Each microservice can use the technology stack that is best suited for the specific component, allowing for flexibility in using the latest or most appropriate technologies for different tasks.

Fault Isolation: Microservices support fault tolerance by ensuring that a failure in one service does not compromise the functionality of others. This is critical for a system handling environmental emergencies like flooding.

Ease of Adoption of Future Technologies: As new technologies emerge, individual microservices can be updated or replaced with minimal impact on the overall system, facilitating ongoing evolution and adaptation.

Implementation Considerations
Service Communication: Implement an API Gateway to manage requests and facilitate communication between microservices, ensuring efficient routing and load balancing.

Data Management: Depending on the use cases, consider using a shared data store in a polyglot manner or individual databases for services to promote data decoupling.

Monitoring and Logging: Establish centralized logging and monitoring solutions to track the performance of each microservice and quickly diagnose issues.

Security: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure communication between services, especially concerning sensitive user data and alerts.

Containerization: Leverage containerization (e.g., Docker) for deploying microservices to ensure consistency across environments and ease of orchestration (e.g., using Kubernetes).


## Consequence 

By adopting a microservices architecture, FMMS can achieve high flexibility, scalability, and resilience, ensuring its capability to manage flood monitoring and responses efficiently in a rapidly changing environment.
