# Architectural pattern for data Ingestion and Processing of High-Volume,
Real-Time Sensor Data _Zeroshot

## Status
Proposed

## Context

Flood Monitoring and Management System must process large volumes of
real-time data from up to 150,000 sensors deployed across various locations, each
sending frequent updates on environmental conditions. There is a need for an
architecture pattern that can enable the system to handle continuous data streams
efficiently, with minimal latency, even during peak load periods. This decision must
consider both normal operating conditions and high-stress events when multiple sensors
may transmit critical alerts simultaneously

## Decision

To efficiently handle the processing of large volumes of real-time data from up to 150,000 sensors, we will adopt a Microservices Architecture combined with an Event-Driven Architecture using a Stream Processing Framework. This approach is chosen to ensure scalability, flexibility, and low-latency processing in both normal and peak load conditions.
Rationale
- Scalability: Microservices allow us to scale individual components independently. When certain parts of the system experience high load (e.g., sensor data ingestion or processing), we can scale those services without affecting others.
- Event-Driven Processing: Utilizing an event-driven model will enable the system to react promptly to data coming from sensors. As sensors generate data, events can be published to a message broker (such as Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis), ensuring that data is processed as soon as it is available.
- Stream Processing Framework: Implementing a stream processing framework (like Apache Flink, Apache Storm, or Spark Streaming) will facilitate the efficient processing of continuous data streams. This setup is capable of handling real-time processing while ensuring low latency, even when multiple sensors send critical alerts.
- Resilience and Fault Tolerance: By deploying services independently and isolating failures, the system can continue to function during peak periods without complete breakdown. Utilizing a message broker provides durability and guarantees message delivery.
- Load Balancing: The architecture will support load balancing, ensuring that incoming data streams from sensors are distributed evenly across processing nodes, mitigating sudden surges caused by multiple alert transmissions.

- Data Storage and Retrieval: Sensor data can be ingested, processed, and stored in a time-series database (like InfluxDB) or a NoSQL database (like Cassandra) for efficient querying. This allows for both immediate processing of alerts and historical data analysis.

## Consequences

By adopting a microservices architecture with an event-driven approach and leveraging a stream processing framework, the Flood Monitoring and Management System will meet the requirements for handling a large volume of real-time data efficiently, providing resilience during peak loads and ensuring timely processing of critical environmental alerts from sensors.
