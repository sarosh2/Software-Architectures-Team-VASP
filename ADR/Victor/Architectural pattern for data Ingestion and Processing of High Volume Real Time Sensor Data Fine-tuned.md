# Architectural pattern for data Ingestion and Processing of High-Volume,
Real-Time Sensor Data _Fine-tuned

## Status
Proposed

## Context

Flood Monitoring and Management System must process large volumes of
real-time data from up to 150,000 sensors deployed across various locations, each
sending frequent updates on environmental conditions. There is a need for an
architecture pattern that can enable the system to handle continuous data streams
efficiently, with minimal latency, even during peak load periods. This decision must
consider both normal operating conditions and high-stress events when multiple sensors
may transmit critical alerts simultaneously

## Decision

The system will use Apache Kafka as the primary mechanism for receiving and dispatching the data stream from the sensors to the applications. The the data stream output from Kafka will go to the Stream Analyst and eventually to the Data Warehouse\n### Overview\nThis product option relies on the leader in event topic management, Apache Kafka (Kafka) to receive the raw data stream from the sensors and push it to the applications. This design ensures that the data will always be.
