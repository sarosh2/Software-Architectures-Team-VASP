# Architectural pattern for data Ingestion and Processing of High-Volume,
Real-Time Sensor Data _RAG

## Status
Proposed

## Context

Flood Monitoring and Management System must process large volumes of
real-time data from up to 150,000 sensors deployed across various locations, each
sending frequent updates on environmental conditions. There is a need for an
architecture pattern that can enable the system to handle continuous data streams
efficiently, with minimal latency, even during peak load periods. This decision must
consider both normal operating conditions and high-stress events when multiple sensors
may transmit critical alerts simultaneously

## Decision

We will adopt an Event-Driven Microservices architecture with a focus on Stream Processing. This architecture is well-suited for handling large volumes of real-time data and can efficiently process continuous data streams from a vast number of sensors (up to 150,000).
Rationale
- Scalability: The event-driven model allows for dynamic scaling, which is crucial for accommodating varying loads, especially during high-stress events when multiple sensors may send critical alerts simultaneously.
- Low Latency: By utilizing technologies such as Apache Kafka for data ingestion and stream processing tools (e.g., Apache Flink or Apache Spark Streaming), we can ensure that data from sensors is processed with minimal latency, providing timely insights and alerts.
- Resilience: This architecture inherently supports fault tolerance and resilience, as individual microservices can fail without bringing down the entire system. This is vital for ensuring the reliability of the flood monitoring and management system.
- Decoupling: By decoupling the components of the system, we can develop, deploy, and scale each part independently. This allows for more agile and responsive software development practices.
- Real-Time Analytics: Stream processing allows for real-time analytics capabilities, enabling the system to analyze environmental conditions as they occur and respond promptly to potential flood risks.

## Consequences

Positive Consequences
Improved responsiveness and flexibility in handling sensor data.
Ability to process high volumes of data continuously while maintaining performance during peak loads.
System can easily integrate with other services for alerting, notifications, and data storage.

Negative Consequences
Increased complexity in managing an event-driven architecture and microservices.
Requires a robust monitoring and management strategy to handle the distributed nature of microservices.
Overall, an Event-Driven Microservices architecture addresses the critical requirements of the Flood Monitoring and Management System, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and scalability for both normal and peak load conditions.
