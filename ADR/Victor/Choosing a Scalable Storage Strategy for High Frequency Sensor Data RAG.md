#  Choosing a Scalable Storage Strategy for High Frequency Sensor Data RAG

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The Flood monitoring and Management system will receive continuous data 
from up to 150,000 sensors. To handle this large volume, the system needs a storage 
approach that can support rapid data ingestion, quick retrieval, and long-term scalability 
as the number of sensors grows. The chosen strategy must accommodate the 
high-frequency nature of data updates while ensuring efficient performance under peak 
loads.

## Decision

We will implement a Time Series Database (TSDB) such as InfluxDB or TimescaleDB as the storage solution for the Flood Monitoring and Management system. This choice is driven by the following reasons:

Rapid Data Ingestion: TSDBs are optimized for high write loads, making them ideal for handling the continuous stream of data from 150,000 sensors.
Quick Retrieval: These databases provide efficient querying capabilities to retrieve the time-series data for analysis and visualization in real-time. They often include built-in functions for aggregations and transformations that are valuable for monitoring systems.

Long-Term Scalability: TSDBs inherently support retention policies and data downsampling, allowing the system to handle increasing volumes of data over time without significant performance degradation.
High-Frequency Updates: They are designed to efficiently handle high-frequency data updates, ensuring that our system can cope with peak loads during critical situations.

Cost-Effectiveness: By leveraging open-source TSDB technologies (like InfluxDB or TimescaleDB), we can optimize initial investment while benefitting from community support and extensibility.
Integration Capabilities: Both InfluxDB and TimescaleDB easily integrate with various data analytics and visualization tools, which we may utilize to extract insights from the sensor data.
This architectural decision aligns well with the need for scalability, performance, and operational resilience as the flood monitoring system evolves.
