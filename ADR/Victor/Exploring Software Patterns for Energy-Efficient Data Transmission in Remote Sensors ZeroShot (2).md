# Exploring Software Patterns for Energy-Efficient Data Transmission in Remote Sensors ZeroShot

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The sensors of Flood Monitoring and Management Systems are installed in 
remote and hard-to-reach locations with limited power sources. To ensure prolonged 
sensor operation, the systemâ€™s software architecture must consider patterns that support 
energy efficiency by optimizing data transmission. This requires a design that reduces 
the frequency of non-critical data transmissions while ensuring that critical updates are 
transmitted promptly. The architecture must balance responsiveness with energyconservation, prompting a decision on which software patterns can help achieve efficient 
data handling to extend sensor battery life without compromising system reliability

## Decision

To address the need for energy-efficient data transmission in Flood Monitoring and Management Systems deployed in remote locations, we will adopt an event-driven architecture complemented by data filtering and adaptive transmission strategies.

Rationale:
Event-Driven Architecture: This approach allows sensors to operate in a reactive manner, sending data only when specific events occur (e.g., when water levels exceed a threshold). This reduces unnecessary data transmission, leading to significant energy savings.

Data Filtering: Implementing layers of data filtering to prioritize critical updates ensures that only essential information is transmitted immediately. Non-critical data can be batched and sent less frequently, reducing the load on the communication channel and conserving battery life.

Adaptive Transmission Strategies: We will utilize techniques such as:

Adaptive Sampling: Adjusting the frequency of data collection based on environmental conditions (e.g., increasing sampling during heavy rainfalls).
Threshold-Based Reporting: Sending updates only when sensor readings cross predefined thresholds, thereby minimizing the number of transmissions.
Low-Power Communication Protocols: Utilizing energy-efficient communication protocols (like LoRaWAN or Zigbee) that are specifically designed for low power and long-range connectivity.
Benefits:
Prolonged sensor battery life by reducing the number of data transmissions.
Enhanced system reliability by ensuring timely updates for critical events.
Flexibility to accommodate varying environmental conditions and system requirements.
Risks & Mitigations:
Risk of missed data: Critical data may be missed if the filtering threshold is not set appropriately. Mitigation: Regularly review and adjust thresholds based on historical data and predictive modeling.

Complexity of implementation: Transitioning to an event-driven model with filtering and adaptive strategies may add complexity. Mitigation: Provide thorough training for development and operational teams and incrementally implement these patterns to ensure a smooth transition.

## Consequence

Employing an event-driven architecture with accompanying data filtering and adaptive transmission methods will create a robust solution for ensuring energy-efficient and reliable data transmission in remote flood monitoring systems.
