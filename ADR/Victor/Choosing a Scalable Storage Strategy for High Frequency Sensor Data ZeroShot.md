#  Choosing a Scalable Storage Strategy for High Frequency Sensor Data ZeroShot

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The Flood monitoring and Management system will receive continuous data 
from up to 150,000 sensors. To handle this large volume, the system needs a storage 
approach that can support rapid data ingestion, quick retrieval, and long-term scalability 
as the number of sensors grows. The chosen strategy must accommodate the 
high-frequency nature of data updates while ensuring efficient performance under peak 
loads.

## Decision

Adopt a time-series database (TSDB) for the storage and management of data collected from the 150,000 sensors in the Flood Monitoring and Management System.
Rationale
- High-frequency Data Ingestion: Time-series databases, such as InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, or OpenTSDB, are specifically optimized for handling high-frequency data updates and can efficiently ingest large volumes of data in real-time.
- Performance Under Peak Loads: TSDBs are designed to handle read and write operations at scale, accommodating fluctuations in data ingestion rates, especially during peak events associated with flooding.

- Data Retrieval: These databases support efficient querying capabilities, allowing for quick retrieval of time-series data, which is essential for real-time monitoring and decision-making in flood conditions.
- Scalability: The chosen TSDB solutions generally provide horizontal scalability, enabling the system to grow seamlessly as the number of sensors and data volume increase without significant performance degradation.
Retention Policies and Compression: Time-series databases typically offer built-in data retention policies and compression techniques, allowing for efficient long-term storage while maintaining access to historical data trends.
Specialized Querying: TSDBs provide robust support for aggregation, down-sampling, and statistical analyses on time-series data, which is beneficial for analyzing trends, identifying anomalies, and producing visualizations for users.

## Consequences

- The system will require expertise in the selected TSDB technology for configuration, optimization, and maintenance.
- Initial setup and architectural design should focus on proper schema design and indexing strategies to maximize performance.
- Regular assessment of data retention and archival strategies will be necessary to manage storage costs while ensuring essential historical data remains accessible.
- As new sensors are added or data volume increases, monitoring and adjusting the infrastructure may be needed to maintain performance levels.
- By implementing a time-series database, the Flood Monitoring and Management System will achieve the necessary performance, scalability, and efficiency required for effective flood monitoring and response.
