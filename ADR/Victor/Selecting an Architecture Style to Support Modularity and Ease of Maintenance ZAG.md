# Selecting an Architecture Style to Support Modularity and Ease of Maintenance ZAG

## Status
Proposed

## Context
 Flood Monitoring and Management System (FMMS) involves multiple 
components—data ingestion, processing, alerting, and user management—that may 
evolve independently over time. For flexibility in development, deployment, and 
maintenance, the architecture needs a modular design that enables isolated updates, 
scalability, and troubleshooting for individual components without impacting the entire 
system. The architecture style must support this modularity, allowing FMMS to adapt to 
future requirements and updates efficiently
