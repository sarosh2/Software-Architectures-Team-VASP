# Exploring Software Patterns for Energy-Efficient Data Transmission in Remote Sensors RAG

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The sensors of Flood Monitoring and Management Systems are installed in 
remote and hard-to-reach locations with limited power sources. To ensure prolonged 
sensor operation, the systemâ€™s software architecture must consider patterns that support 
energy efficiency by optimizing data transmission. This requires a design that reduces 
the frequency of non-critical data transmissions while ensuring that critical updates are 
transmitted promptly. The architecture must balance responsiveness with energyconservation, prompting a decision on which software patterns can help achieve efficient 
data handling to extend sensor battery life without compromising system reliability

## Decision

Adopt an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) combined with a Publish-Subscribe pattern for efficient data transmission in the Flood Monitoring and Management Systems.

Key Components:
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA): Utilize an event-driven approach whereby sensors emit events (data changes) only when significant changes are detected or when critical thresholds are crossed, reducing the frequency of data transmissions during normal operation.

Publish-Subscribe Pattern: Implement a publish-subscribe model where sensors can publish data updates/events to a message broker with subscribers (data processors or monitoring systems) listening for only critical updates, allowing for efficient data handling and reduced unnecessary transmissions.

Data Prioritization: Create a mechanism within the publishing system to classify data into 'critical' and 'non-critical' categories, ensuring that critical data is transmitted immediately while non-critical data is batched and sent at predetermined intervals.

Adaptive Transmission Rates: Integrate algorithms that allow the system to adaptively adjust the transmission frequency based on factors such as battery charge level, environmental conditions, and network availability to further enhance energy efficiency.

## Consequence

Positive Consequences:
Extended battery life of remote sensors through reduced non-critical data transmissions.
Improved responsiveness to critical events, enhancing system reliability in monitoring flood conditions.
Lower energy consumption results in fewer maintenance interventions for sensor battery replacements.

Negative Consequences:

Increased complexity of the system design due to the need for event handling and classification mechanisms.
Dependence on a message broker and the potential need for additional infrastructure to manage event-driven communication.
By implementing this event-driven architecture with publish-subscribe patterns, we can effectively achieve a balance between energy conservation and system responsiveness, leading to an efficient flood monitoring solution.
