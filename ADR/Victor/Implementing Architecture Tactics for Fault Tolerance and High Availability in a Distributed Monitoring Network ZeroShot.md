# Implementing Architecture Tactics for Fault Tolerance and High Availability in a Distributed Monitoring Network ZeroShot

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Flood Monitoring and Management System relies on a distributed 
network of sensors and subsystems to monitor environmental conditions in flood-prone 
areas. The system must remain operational even when hardware or communication 
failures occur due to adverse environmental conditions or high data load. This requires 
an architecture that can mitigate the risks of service interruptions and data loss. To 
address these challenges, a decision is needed on which fault-tolerance and availability 
tactics—such as redundancy, failover handling, or data replication—can best support the 
system’s requirement for continuous and reliable monitoring under various operating 
conditions.

## Decision

To ensure the Flood Monitoring and Management System can maintain its operational integrity under adverse conditions and potential failures, the following architectural tactics will be implemented:

Redundancy:

Deploy multiple sensor nodes in each critical monitoring area to ensure that there is always an operational sensor available. This includes hardware redundancy (e.g., backup sensors) and communication path redundancy (e.g., multiple communication channels).
Utilize redundant processing units that can take over in case the primary processing unit fails, thus preventing single points of failure.
Failover Handling:

Implement automatic failover mechanisms to switch from a failed sensor or subsystem to its standby counterpart without manual intervention. This includes real-time health monitoring of all nodes and subsystems to quickly detect failures.
Design the system to notify relevant stakeholders through alerts when a failover occurs, ensuring that the operational status is transparent and action can be taken if necessary.
Data Replication:

Incorporate data replication strategies where sensor data is replicated across multiple storage systems or nodes. This will ensure that even if one part of the system becomes unavailable, the data remains accessible from other nodes.
Implement buffering mechanisms to temporarily hold data during periods of high load or when communication failures occur, ensuring no data is lost during transmission.
Load Balancing:

Use load balancing techniques to distribute operational tasks across multiple sensors and nodes. This will help to manage high data loads effectively and reduce the risk of overloading any single component.
Graceful Degradation:

Design the system to allow for graceful degradation. In the event of failure, the system should continue to operate with reduced functionality rather than become completely inoperative, ensuring that critical monitoring is still possible.
Regular Backup and Recovery Procedures:

Establish scheduled backups of configuration settings, historical data, and operational states to recover quickly from major failures or data corruption issues.

## Consequence

By combining these tactics, the Flood Monitoring and Management System will be robust against a wide range of hardware and communication failures, ensuring high availability and reliability for critical environmental monitoring. This architecture will significantly mitigate the risk of service interruptions and data loss, thereby fulfilling the system's operational requirements.
