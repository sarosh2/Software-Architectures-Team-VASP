# Implementing Architecture Tactics for Fault Tolerance and High Availability in a Distributed Monitoring Network RAG

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Flood Monitoring and Management System relies on a distributed 
network of sensors and subsystems to monitor environmental conditions in flood-prone 
areas. The system must remain operational even when hardware or communication 
failures occur due to adverse environmental conditions or high data load. This requires 
an architecture that can mitigate the risks of service interruptions and data loss. To 
address these challenges, a decision is needed on which fault-tolerance and availability 
tactics—such as redundancy, failover handling, or data replication—can best support the 
system’s requirement for continuous and reliable monitoring under various operating 
conditions.

## Decision

We will implement a combination of redundancy and data replication tactics to ensure fault tolerance and high availability in the Flood Monitoring and Management System. Specifically, we will:

Deploy Redundant Sensors and Subsystems: Each monitoring location will have multiple sensors where feasible. This will allow the system to continue functioning if one sensor fails. Additionally, subsystems that process data from these sensors will also have redundancy so that if one subsystem encounters a fault, another can take over seamlessly.

Implement Failover Handling Mechanisms: We will use a failover strategy that automatically switches from a failed component (sensor or subsystem) to a backup component without manual intervention. This will be managed by a centralized monitoring and control service that detects component failures and initiates failover procedures.

Utilize Data Replication: Sensor data will be replicated across multiple databases to ensure that even in the event of a database failure, data integrity and availability are maintained. This replication will utilize asynchronous mechanisms to minimize latency but ensure data is consistently available.

Adopt Event Sourcing for Data Changes: To enhance data durability during adverse events, we will employ event sourcing, which records all changes as discrete events. This approach allows us to reconstruct past states of data and ensures that no information is lost, even during failures.

Incorporate Health Check and Monitoring: All components will include health check endpoints that can be polled by our monitoring system. This will provide real-time insights into the status of each component and help in proactive fault detection.

## Consequence

Positive Consequences:

Increased reliability of the monitoring system, which can continue operating under various failure conditions.
Reduced risk of data loss, as replicated data ensures information is preserved even if one component fails.
Improved system resilience, allowing quicker recovery from hardware or communication failures.

Negative Consequences:

Additional complexity in management and deployment due to the need for redundant components and replication strategies.
Increased resource usage and potential cost implications associated with maintaining multiple instances of sensors and databases.
This decision aligns with our goal to provide continuous and reliable monitoring in flood-prone areas, ensuring that the Flood Monitoring and Management System can meet operational demands regardless of external challenges.
