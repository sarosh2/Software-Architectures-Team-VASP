# ADR: 
We will adopt a microservices architecture utilizing Apache Kafka as the core event streaming platform, combined with Kafka Streams for real-time data processing. This architecture pattern allows us to efficiently handle continuous data streams from up to 150,000 sensors while maintaining low latency even during peak load periods.

## Rationale

1. **High Throughput and Low Latency**: Apache Kafka is designed to handle large volumes of data with high throughput and low latency. This is essential for processing updates from numerous sensors in real time.
2. **Scalability**: The microservices architecture enables us to independently scale various components of the system based on demand. This is critical during high-stress events where multiple sensors might transmit critical data simultaneously.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Kafkaâ€™s distributed nature provides resiliency against failures. In case of hardware or service outages, data integrity is maintained, ensuring we do not lose critical information during floods.
4. **Event-Driven Processing**: Using Kafka Streams allows for the development of a reactive system that can process incoming data streams and make real-time decisions, crucial for monitoring environmental changes effectively.
5. **Ease of Integration**: This architecture can easily integrate additional services and data sources, allowing for flexibility as new sensors or features are added to the system.

## Positive Consequences
- Enhanced ability to respond to critical alerts with minimal delay due to efficient event stream processing.
- Reduced operational bottlenecks as different components can operate and scale independently.
- Increased ability to analyze trends and provide insights based on real-time sensor data.

## Negative Consequences
- Initial complexity in setting up a Kafka-based infrastructure may require additional development and operational expertise.
- The need to monitor and manage additional components (e.g., Kafka brokers, stream processing applications), which might lead to increased overhead in terms of maintenance.

## Conclusion
Implementing a microservices architecture using Apache Kafka will provide the necessary framework for efficient, scalable, and resilient flood monitoring and management.
