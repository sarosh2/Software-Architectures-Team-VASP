# ADR: Adopt a Microservices Architecture

## Decision
To fulfill the requirements of the Flood Monitoring and Management System (FMMS) for modular design and independent component evolution, we will implement a microservices architecture. This decision is based on the following rationale:

## Rationale
1. **Modularity**: Each component of FMMS (data ingestion, processing, alerting, user management) will be developed as independent microservices. This allows teams to work on different components concurrently, facilitating agile development practices.
2. **Scalability**: Microservices can be scaled independently based on the demands of each service. For instance, if data ingestion experiences high traffic during flood events, we can scale up just that service without affecting others.
3. **Deployment Flexibility**: Updates or new features can be deployed to individual components without needing to redeploy the entire system. This minimizes downtime and reduces risk during updates.
4. **Troubleshooting and Maintenance**: Isolated deployments make it easier to troubleshoot and maintain components, as issues can be addressed within specific services without impacting others.
5. **Adaptability**: Microservices facilitate the incorporation of new technologies and practices. As the FMMS evolves, we can adopt new tools or methodologies for individual services, ensuring the architecture remains relevant and efficient.

## Summary
Adopting a microservices architecture for the FMMS will provide the necessary modularity and flexibility to support current and future demands effectively.
