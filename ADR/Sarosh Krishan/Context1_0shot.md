# ADR: Implement a Microservices Architecture with an Event-Driven Design Pattern using Apache Kafka for handling real-time data streaming.

## Rationale

1. **Scalability**: A microservices architecture allows the system to scale horizontally. Each microservice can be independently scaled based on the load, particularly during peak periods when large numbers of sensor data are sent simultaneously.
2. **Event-Driven Processing**: Using Apache Kafka as the backbone for the event-driven model enables the system to efficiently manage streams of data. Kafka’s distributed nature provides high throughput, fault tolerance, and low latency for real-time data processing.
3. **Decoupling of Components**: Microservices can interact through asynchronous messaging patterns facilitated by Kafka, allowing for decoupling between components. This enables services to operate independently and manage spikes in traffic without affecting system performance.
4. **High Availability**: Kafka can persist data, allowing for higher availability and durability. In the event of service failures or system overloads, messages can be queued and processed later without data loss.
5. **Flexibility and Maintainability**: Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently, making the system flexible to changes in requirements or technology over time. This is particularly beneficial in an evolving field like flood monitoring, where sensor technology and requirements may change.
6. **Real-Time Processing with Stream Processing Frameworks**: Integrating stream processing frameworks such as Apache Flink or Apache Spark Streaming can allow for real-time computation and analysis of the data streams coming from the sensors, facilitating real-time alerts and responsive actions during critical events.
7. **Load Balancing**: Implementing load balancing strategies (e.g., using a Kubernetes cluster) will ensure that peak loads are handled efficiently, distributing the workload evenly across instances of microservices to prevent bottlenecks.

## Conclusion
This architectural decision supports both the normal operating conditions and high-stress events, ensuring that the Flood Monitoring and Management System remains responsive and effective in a variety of scenarios.
