# ADR: InfluxDB for Flood Monitoring and Management

## Decision
We will implement InfluxDB as our time series database for the Flood Monitoring and Management system.

## Rationale
InfluxDB is specifically designed to handle high write and query loads, which is essential given the anticipated volume of data from up to 150,000 sensors. It excels in rapid data ingestion, making it suitable for high-frequency updates from a large number of sensors. Additionally, InfluxDB provides powerful querying capabilities, enabling quick retrieval of data for analysis and reporting.

The database is highly scalable, allowing us to seamlessly accommodate future growth as the number of sensors and data volume increases. Its built-in retention policies and continuous queries will help manage data over time, ensuring efficient performance under peak loads while also optimizing storage resources.

## Positive Consequences
- Efficient handling of large volumes of continuous data.
- Quick access and retrieval of time series data for real-time analytics.
- Scalability to support growth over time with minimal infrastructure changes.

## Negative Consequences
- Potential learning curve for development and operational teams unfamiliar with InfluxDB.
- Need to monitor and manage performance tuning as data volume increases.
