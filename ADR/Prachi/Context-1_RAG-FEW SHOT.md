# Context
Flood Monitoring and Management System must process large volumes of real-time data from up to 150,000 sensors deployed across various locations, each sending frequent updates on environmental conditions. There is a need for an architecture pattern that can enable the system to handle continuous data streams efficiently, with minimal latency, even during peak load periods. This decision must consider both normal operating conditions and high-stress events when multiple sensors may transmit critical alerts simultaneously. Please suggest a software architecture style which can handle the peak data and handle fault tolerance

## Decision
 We will adopt a Microservices Architecture pattern combined with Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) to effectively manage the ingestion and processing of high-volume, real-time sensor data from our Flood Monitoring and Management System.
Rationale
1.    Scalability: By leveraging microservices, we can independently scale different components of the system (data ingestion, processing, storage) based on the load. This enables the system to accommodate the influx of data from up to 150,000 sensors without overloading any single service.
2.    Event-Driven Architecture: Implementing an event-driven model using a robust messaging system (such as Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ) allows us to decouple the data ingestion from the processing. This ensures that the system can handle bursts of activity (like simultaneous sensor alerts) by buffering incoming data and processing it asynchronously.
3.    Fault Tolerance: Utilizing a combination of message queuing and stream processing technologies enhances fault tolerance. If a service goes down or is overloaded, the incoming data can be stored in the queue without loss. Furthermore, we can deploy techniques like circuit breakers and retries to manage service failures.
4.    Low Latency Processing: With stream processing frameworks like Apache Flink or Apache Spark Streaming, we can perform real-time analytics and processing of the data as it arrives, ensuring minimal latency in responding to critical environmental conditions.
5.    Dynamic Data Routing: The system can dynamically route events to the appropriate microservices based on predefined rules, ensuring that critical alerts are prioritized and handled promptly.


## Considerations
 •    Deployment: Use container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) to manage the deployment and scaling of microservices effectively.
•    Monitoring and Alerting: Implement robust monitoring and observability capabilities to track the health of services and ensure quick response to anomalies.
•    Data Retention Policies: Define clear data retention and archiving strategies to manage the large volumes of historical sensor data collected over time.
By combining a microservices architecture with an event-driven model, we can ensure that the Flood Monitoring and Management System is resilient, scalable, and capable of processing high-volume real-time data even under peak load conditions.
