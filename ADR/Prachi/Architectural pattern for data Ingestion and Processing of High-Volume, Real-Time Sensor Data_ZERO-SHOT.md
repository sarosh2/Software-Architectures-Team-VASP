# Context
Flood Monitoring and Management System must process large volumes of real-time data from up to 150,000 sensors deployed across various locations, each sending frequent updates on environmental conditions. There is a need for an architecture pattern that can enable the system to handle continuous data streams efficiently, with minimal latency, even during peak load periods. This decision must consider both normal operating conditions and high-stress events when multiple sensors may transmit critical alerts simultaneously.

##Decision
 Utilize a Microservices Architecture with Stream Processing and Event-Driven Design
Rationale:
1.    Microservices Architecture: By decomposing the system into smaller, independent services, we can achieve better scalability and resilience. Each microservice can handle specific tasks, such as data ingestion, processing, storage, and alerting. This separation allows for independent deployment and scaling based on demand.
2.    Stream Processing: Implement a stream processing framework, such as Apache Kafka or Apache Flink, to handle real-time data streams. These platforms are well-suited for processing high volumes of data with low latency and allow for parallel processing, which is essential when dealing with peaks of data coming from 150,000 sensors.
3.    Event-Driven Design: Adopting an event-driven architecture allows the system to react to events (sensor updates, critical alerts) in real-time. With this model, microservices can subscribe to and process events as they occur, which reduces the waiting time and enhances responsiveness. This is particularly important during critical events when multiple sensors may send alerts.
4.    Load Balancing and Autoscaling: To manage peak loads effectively, implement load balancers that distribute incoming sensor data across multiple service instances and use container orchestration tools (like Kubernetes) to auto-scale microservices based on the current load. This ensures that even during high-stress events, the system can dynamically adjust its processing capacity.
5.    Data Storage Solutions: Utilize a combination of time-series databases (e.g., InfluxDB) for storing sensor data, and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB or Cassandra) for managing unstructured alert data and logs. This combination allows for efficient querying and retrieval of data under different load conditions.
Benefits:
•    Scalability: Each component can scale independently based on demand, ensuring that the system can handle sudden spikes in data volume.
•    Resilience: If one service fails, it does not bring down the entire system, which is critical for a flood monitoring system where real-time data processing is crucial.
•    Flexibility: New sensors or data sources can be added without significant changes to the core architecture.
•    Real-time Processing: Enables immediate response to environmental changes or alerts based on predefined thresholds.

##Considerations
 •    Ensure robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms are in place to detect failures or bottlenecks in the system.
•    Implement data validation and filtering to handle anomalies and ensure only relevant data is processed.
•    Plan for disaster recovery and data retention policies for historical data analysis and compliance purposes.
