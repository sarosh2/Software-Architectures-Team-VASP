# Context
The Flood Monitoring and Management System relies on a distributed network of sensors and subsystems to monitor environmental conditions in flood-prone areas. The system must remain operational even when hardware or communication failures occur due to adverse environmental conditions or high data load. This requires an architecture that can mitigate the risks of service interruptions and data loss. To address these challenges, a decision is needed on which fault-tolerance and availability tactics—such as redundancy, failover handling, or data replication—can best support the system’s requirement for continuous and reliable monitoring under various operating conditions . Recommend  architecture tactics that ensure fault tolerance and reliable backup subsystems in a distributed system?
## Status
proposed

## Decision:
To ensure fault tolerance and reliable backup subsystems in the Flood Monitoring and Management System, we will implement the following architecture tactics:
1.    Redundancy:
o    Hardware Redundancy: Utilize multiple sensors in each flood-prone area to capture data. If one sensor fails, others can continue to provide critical information.
o    Service Redundancy: Deploy multiple instances of application services that process the incoming data from sensors. Load balancers will distribute tasks across these instances to ensure no single point of failure.
2.    Data Replication:
o    Implement a distributed database system that synchronously or asynchronously replicates data across multiple nodes. This ensures that even if one database node fails, the data remains accessible from another node.
3.    Failover Handling:
o    Establish automatic failover mechanisms that are triggered when a sensor or service becomes unresponsive. This could involve rerouting sensor data collection to an active standby service or sensor, ensuring seamless operation.
4.    Message Queuing:
o    Integrate a message queuing system (like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ) to buffer data during high-load situations or when certain components are down. This will prevent data loss and allow systems to catch up once they are back online.
5.    Health Monitoring and Self-Healing:
o    Implement a monitoring system that continually checks the health of sensors and services. Upon detecting a failure, the system should attempt to restart failed components automatically or notify operators for manual intervention.
6.    Geographic Distribution:
o    Distribute sensor data processing nodes across different geographical locations. In the event of localized failures (like power outages or natural disasters), other nodes can take over the processing tasks, ensuring continuous monitoring.
7.    Version Control for Configuration:
o    Maintain version-controlled configurations for all system components. In case an update causes a failure, the system can quickly roll back to the last stable configuration.
8.    Regular Backups:
o    Schedule regular backups of critical configuration data and sensor readings to a secure location (including cloud storage) to prevent data loss and enable restoration after failures.
These tactics together create a robust architecture that enhances the resilience, reliability, and availability of the Flood Monitoring and Management System, ensuring it can withstand different failure scenarios and continue to operate effectively in monitoring flood-prone areas.
