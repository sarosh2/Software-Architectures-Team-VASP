# Context
Flood Monitoring and Management System (FMMS) involves multiple components—data ingestion, processing, alerting, and user management—that may evolve independently over time. For flexibility in development, deployment, and maintenance, the architecture needs a modular design that enables isolated updates, scalability, and troubleshooting for individual components without impacting the entire system. The architecture style must support this modularity, allowing FMMS to adapt to future requirements and updates efficiently. SA style that will provide the ability to replace or update components without disrupting others.
## Status
rejected
## Decision: 
 Adopt a Microservices Architecture for the Flood Monitoring and Management System (FMMS). This architecture style will facilitate independent development, deployment, and scalability of the various components (data ingestion, processing, alerting, and user management) while allowing for isolated updates and maintenance without disrupting the overall system. This modular approach aligns well with the system’s need to adapt to future requirements and updates efficiently.
