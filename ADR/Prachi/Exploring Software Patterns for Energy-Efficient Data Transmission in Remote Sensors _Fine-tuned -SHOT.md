# Exploring Software Patterns for Energy-Efficient Data Transmission in Remote Sensors

## rejected

## The sensors of Flood Monitoring and Management Systems are installed in remote and hard-to-reach locations with limited power sources. To ensure prolonged sensor operation, the system’s software architecture must consider patterns that support energy efficiency by optimizing data transmission. This requires a design that reduces the frequency of non-critical data transmissions while ensuring that critical updates are transmitted promptly. The architecture must balance responsiveness with energy conservation, prompting a decision on which software patterns can help achieve efficient data handling to extend sensor battery life without compromising system reliability. which design principal can result in effective system reliability and maximize the battery life.




## :  We will use a Double-рутine architecture that separates the Fetch/Se mange cycle from the Control/\creativecommons cycle. baudrate of transmission is also adjusted according to the state of the system to optimize the battery life.## Consequences: * The design is less complex and easier to understand & explain. * Development is easier. * Unit testing simpler. * Less architectural contortions. * Develop apps faster. * Respond to changes faster. * Battery life extended. * Fewer apps
