# Context
The Flood monitoring and Management system will receive continuous data from up to 150,000 sensors. To handle this large volume, the system needs a storage approach that can support rapid data ingestion, quick retrieval, and long-term scalability as the number of sensors grows. The chosen strategy must accommodate the high-frequency nature of data updates while ensuring efficient performance under peak loads. recommend some architecture that are scalable and can regulate with high velocity data transmission for above scenario. also mention the reasons for recommended SA styles

## Status
proposed
## Decision:
 We will adopt a microservices architecture combined with a data streaming and time-series storage strategy for handling the high-frequency sensor data from the Flood Monitoring and Management system.
Recommended Architecture Components:
1.    Data Ingestion Layer (Apache Kafka):
o    Reason: Kafka provides a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling high-throughput data ingestion. It allows us to buffer incoming data streams from 150,000 sensors efficiently and supports scaling as the number of sensors increases. Kafka can handle millions of events per second, which is essential for high-frequency data inputs.
2.    Stream Processing (Apache Flink or Apache Spark Streaming):
o    Reason: Stream processing frameworks will allow us to process data in real-time. They can perform analytics, transformations, and react to incoming data promptly. Flink, for instance, offers low latency and high scalability, which are critical when dealing with high-velocity sensor data.
3.    Time-Series Database (InfluxDB or TimescaleDB):
o    Reason: Both InfluxDB and TimescaleDB are designed specifically for time-series data, providing efficient storage and retrieval of time-indexed data. They offer the ability to manage high write and query loads while supporting functionalities like continuous queries, downsampling, and retention policies that are essential for managing long-term data from sensors.
4.    Separate Data Query Layer (RESTful API):
o    Reason: A dedicated query layer will allow different services and applications to access the data stored in the time-series database or retrieval system efficiently. This separation promotes scalability and maintainability, allowing independent development and deployment of the API services.
5.    Load Balancing (AWS ELB or Nginx):
o    Reason: To ensure high availability and manage incoming requests efficiently, load balancers will distribute requests across multiple instances of our services. This is critical to support peak loads and provide resilience under high traffic conditions.
Architectural Style Reasons:
•    Microservices Architecture: This style promotes modularity, allowing different components (ingestion, processing, storage, and querying) to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. It accommodates varying loads on different parts of the system without affecting overall performance.
•    Event-Driven Architecture: Utilizing Kafka for data ingestion ensures that we can decouple data producers (sensors) from data consumers (processing services), allowing asynchronous processing and better resource utilization. It also enhances system resilience as services can handle data at their own pace.
•    Scalability: Each component of the architecture can scale horizontally. As more sensors are added, we can deploy more partitions in Kafka, more instances of stream processors, and horizontally scale the database as required.
•    Real-Time Processing: The architecture supports real-time analytics and responses due to its event-driven nature, which is paramount for monitoring and responding quickly to flood conditions based on sensor data.
This strategy provides a robust, flexible, and scalable solution capable of efficiently managing the continuous and high-velocity influx of data from a large network of sensors.
