# Context
The Flood monitoring and Management system will receive continuous data from up to 150,000 sensors. To handle this large volume, the system needs a storage approach that can support rapid data ingestion, quick retrieval, and long-term scalability as the number of sensors grows. The chosen strategy must accommodate the high-frequency nature of data updates while ensuring efficient performance under peak loads. suggest SA style that can support quick data retrieval for analytics and real-time monitoring while keeping high performance

## Decision
 : Implement a Hybrid Storage Architecture Utilizing Time-Series Database (TSDB) and Cloud Storage Solutions

Rationale: To address the requirements specified for the Flood Monitoring and Management system, a hybrid storage strategy that combines a Time-Series Database (TSDB) for real-time data ingestion and processing, alongside cloud storage solutions for archival and long-term data retention, is recommended.
1.    Time-Series Database (TSDB): A dedicated TSDB like InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, or OpenTSDB will be employed for real-time ingestion and querying of sensor data. TSDBs are optimized for handling high write loads and enable efficient retrieval of time-series data, thereby supporting the high-frequency updates characteristic of sensor data. This allows the system to efficiently manage and analyze incoming data streams from up to 150,000 sensors.
2.    Cloud Storage Solutions: For storing historical data that may not need to be accessed frequently but must be retained for compliance and analysis, cloud storage options like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage will be used. This approach provides cost-effective scaling and easy management of large volumes of data over time. The cold data can be efficiently retrieved when needed without affecting the performance of real-time operations.
Advantages:
•    Scalability: Both the TSDB and cloud storage solutions scale horizontally, allowing the system to add more resources as the number of sensors increases.
•    Performance: TSDBs optimize write-heavy operations, ensuring that rapid ingestion of data does not lead to performance bottlenecks. Query performance remains high for real-time analytics.
•    Cost-Effectiveness: Utilizing cloud storage for archival data enables lower costs for long-term storage, which is crucial given the expected volume of sensor data.
•    Flexibility: This dual approach allows for the flexibility of using different types of storage tailored to specific data usage patterns (real-time vs. archived).
Conclusion:
Leveraging a hybrid storage architecture consisting of a TSDB for high-frequency data ingestion and cloud storage for long-term retention provides an effective and scalable solution. This decision meets the performance requirements while ensuring the system can grow with the increasing number of sensors and their data outputs.
