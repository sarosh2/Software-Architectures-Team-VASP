# Implementing Architecture Tactics for Fault Tolerance and High Availability in a Distributed Monitoring Network

## rejected

## The Flood Monitoring and Management System relies on a distributed network of sensors and subsystems to monitor environmental conditions in flood-prone areas. The system must remain operational even when hardware or communication failures occur due to adverse environmental conditions or high data load. This requires an architecture that can mitigate the risks of service interruptions and data loss. To address these challenges, a decision is needed on which fault-tolerance and availability tactics—such as redundancy, failover handling, or data replication—can best support the system’s requirement for continuous and reliable monitoring under various operating conditions . what is the most effective architecture to handle high data load and can handle fault tolerance while maintaining the continuous monitoring ? give at least 2 reviews


## The recommended architecture integrates the tactics of redundancy, failover support, and data replication to create a resilient system that can withstand a variety of operating conditions. As such, it represents a reasonable choice for building an operative Flood Monitoring and Management System.\n### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n* System has redundancy in hardware, software, and communication that supports failover capacity.\n* Data is replicated between nodes to provide data integrity.\n* The system can operate when environmental conditions or usage causepartial
