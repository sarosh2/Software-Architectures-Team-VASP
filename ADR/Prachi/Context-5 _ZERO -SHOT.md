# Context
 The sensors of Flood Monitoring and Management Systems are installed in remote and hard-to-reach locations with limited power sources. To ensure prolonged sensor operation, the system’s software architecture must consider patterns that support energy efficiency by optimizing data transmission. This requires a design that reduces the frequency of non-critical data transmissions while ensuring that critical updates are transmitted promptly. The architecture must balance responsiveness with energy conservation, prompting a decision on which software patterns can help achieve efficient data handling to extend sensor battery life without compromising system reliability. A SA pattern that we can deploy in remote locations with limited power sources.

## Status
proposed

## Decision
Adopt a Hybrid Data Transmission Pattern within the software architecture of the Flood Monitoring and Management System.

Rationale:
1.    Data Prioritization: The hybrid pattern allows for categorizing data into critical and non-critical segments. Critical data (e.g., flood alerts, sensor failures) can trigger immediate transmission, while non-critical data (e.g., environmental readings) can be batched and sent less frequently.
2.    Event-Driven Architecture: Utilizing an event-driven model ensures that data is transmitted based on significant events or state changes rather than at regular intervals. This reduces unnecessary transmissions, conserving battery life.
3.    Adaptive Transmission Strategy: Implement a mechanism that adapts the frequency of data transmission based on the sensor’s battery level and environmental context. For instance, as battery levels decrease, the system can further limit non-critical data transmission.
4.    Data Compression Techniques: Upon sending necessary data, use data compression techniques to minimize the amount of data transmitted, which in turn reduces energy consumption during transmission.
5.    Wi-Fi or Cellular Offload: If the sensors are equipped with varying connectivity options, leverage higher bandwidth scenarios (like Wi-Fi or cellular) to transmit batched data when the energy state of the sensor allows for it, thus extending operational life in low-power conditions.

## Considerations
•    Monitoring & Management Dashboard: Create a monitoring dashboard that allows operators to visualize sensor data and alert statuses without the need for constant data transmission.
•    Testing Scenarios: Conduct rigorous testing scenarios simulating low power conditions to evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach and make adjustments as needed.
•    Documentation: Ensure thorough documentation and guidelines are established for maintaining the balance between energy conservation and system reliability.
By implementing a Hybrid Data Transmission Pattern, the Flood Monitoring and Management System will be able to maintain effective sensor operation in remote locations while optimizing for energy efficiency.
