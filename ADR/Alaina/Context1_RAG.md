# Decision

We will implement a Lambda architecture for the Flood Monitoring and Management System to efficiently process large volumes of real-time data from up to 150,000 sensors. This architecture pattern is well-suited for handling continuous data streams while allowing for scalability, fault tolerance, and low-latency processing.

## Components of the Lambda Architecture:

1. **Speed Layer**:
   - This layer handles real-time data streams and processes incoming data with minimal latency. We will use Apache Kafka as the message broker to ingest data from sensors due to its high throughput and fault tolerance.
   - For real-time processing, Apache Flink will be used to implement complex event processing and perform immediate analytics on incoming data streams to identify critical alerts and conditions.

2. **Batch Layer**:
   - The batch layer will process historical data that is stored in a distributed file system, such as Hadoop HDFS or Amazon S3. This layer will perform heavy computations and aggregations on historical data to produce precomputed views.
   - Apache Spark will be utilized for batch processing as it provides robust data processing capabilities and can efficiently handle large datasets.

3. **Serving Layer**:
   - This layer will serve precomputed views to provide insights and analytical capabilities to end-users and downstream systems. We will use a fast NoSQL database like Apache Cassandra or Amazon DynamoDB to ensure low-latency access to aggregated data.

## Important Considerations:

- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale horizontally, enabling the addition of more nodes as the volume of incoming data increases.
- **Fault Tolerance**: With Kafka ensuring at-least-once delivery and the distributed nature of both the batch and serving layers, the architecture can withstand failures without data loss.
- **Real-time Alerts**: By employing both the speed and batch layers, we can achieve a balance between real-time alerts for critical conditions and in-depth analysis of historical patterns.

## Positive Consequences:

- The architecture effectively supports both real-time processing and complex historical analytics.
- It can efficiently manage peak loads during high-stress events, ensuring low-latency responses to critical alerts.
- Clear separation of concerns enables easier maintenance and scalability of individual components.

## Negative Consequences:

- Increased complexity due to maintaining both real-time and batch processing systems.
- Potential challenges with data consistency between the speed and batch layers, which requires careful design of reconciliation strategies.

Through the implementation of this Lambda architecture, we aim to establish a resilient and responsive Flood Monitoring and Management System capable of handling high-volume sensor data efficiently.
